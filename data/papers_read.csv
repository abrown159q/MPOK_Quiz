Black,2012,Tropical cyclone unusual intensity and structure change in the western north pacific observed by reconnaissance aircraft during TPARC/TCS08 and ITOP/TCSL0,unique simultaneous observations of typhoon structure and intensity together with underlying oceanic conditions during rapid intensification and rapid decay events in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin,"COMBO drops of AXBT and Dropsondes to observe the ocean control over TC Rapid Intensification (RI) and Rapid Decay (RD) due to pre-existing warm and cold ocean eddy features, as well as the intensity-limiting effects of oceanic 'cold wakes' generated","show contrasting impacts on typhoon development/non-development for cases of strong ocean control and weak environmental shear (pre-Fanapi, 2010) versus cases of weak ocean control and strong environmental shear (disturbance TCS025, 2008).",Medium,,Library de Nicola Center
Wang,2015,"A long-term, high-quality, high-vertical-resolution GPS dropsonde dataset for hurricane and other studies",Use dropsondes to better understand hurricanes,"1995 by NCAR and is currently manufactured by Vaisala, Inc. The dropsonde provides high-quality, high-vertical-resolution (~5–15 m) profiles of atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction from the aircraft flight level to the surface over the hard-to-reach areas",have significantly improved TC-track and TC-intensity forecasts and enable researchers to better understand the characteristics of TCs. Previous studies have shown that dropsonde data alone have improved the hurricanetrack forecasting by as much as 32% and the hurricane intensity by 20% (Aberson and Franklin 1999),Low,,Kitchen de Nicola Center

Wadler,2024,Improving the statistical representation of tropical cyclone in-storm sea surface temperature cooling,"To build predictive equations, SST cooling is first related to single variable predictors such as the SST before storm arrival, ocean heat content (OHC), mixed layer depth, sea surface salinity and stratification, storm intensity, storm translation speed, and latitude",This study uses fixed buoy time series to create an algorithm for sea surface temperature (SST) cooling underneath a tropical cyclone (TC) inner core.,"Of all the single variable predictors, initial SST before storm arrival explains the greatest amount of variance for the change in SST during storm passage. Using a combination of predictors, we created nonlinear predictive equations for SST cooling. In general, the best predictive equations have four predictors and are built with knowledge about the prestorm ocean structure (e.g., OHC), storm intensity (e.g., minimum sea level pressure), initial SST values before storm arrival, and latitude.",Medium,Using different equation and OHC regimes to predict,Downstairs McCourtney
Molinari,2012,CAPE in Tropical Cyclones,,Convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the vertical distribution of buoyancy were calculated for more than 2000 dropsonde soundings collected by the NOAA Gulfstream-IV aircraft.,"The larger downshear CAPE arose from (i) higher surface specific humidity, (ii) lower midtropospheric temperature, and, for entraining CAPE, (iii) larger free-tropospheric relative humidity.",Medium,,Boyd small lecture hall
Sathia,2025,Analytical solution to a nonlinear single column model of hurricane boundary layer wind profiles outside the eyewall,an approximate analytical solution of a nonlinear single column model for horizontal winds that uses a constant eddy viscosity and is valid outside the eyewall.,"building on literature that uses a linearized system of equations, we use a series expansion to account for the nonlinearities.",We find that a first-order correction is sufficient for most practical cases. This solution helps provide a simplified understanding of the sensitivity of the radial and tangential wind profiles to input parameters such as the distance from the storm center and the Coriolis frequency.,Medium,Interesting building of equations for the analytical solution.

Molinari,2013,"Convective bursts, downdraft cooling, and boundary layer recovery in a sheared tropical storm",episodic outbreaks of convection downshear within the storm core in the presence of 11–15 m s21 of ambient vertical wind shear. These outbreaks lasted 2–6 h and were followed by long periods with no deep convection.,Flights from U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft within the boundary layer were used to investigate the cause of one such oscillation.,Consistent with recent papers it is argued that tropical cyclone intensification and decay can be understood as a competition between surface heat and moisture fluxes (‘‘fuel’’) and lowentropy downdrafts into the boundary layer (‘‘antifuel’’).,Medium,,The Matrix study room
Zippel,2025,Energy and stability theory in the wave-affected surface layer of the  atmosphere,address the validity of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory  (MOST) in the wave-affected surface boundary layer of the atmosphere. the influences of surface wave mediated fluxes on MOST have not  been thoroughly quantified,"We assess several months of direct covariance data from a stationary  tower deployed with instruments inside the wave-affected surface layer. These measurements are  analyzed in the context of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation and MOST, extending  previous work due to the inclusion of directly estimated wave-coherent energy fluxes.","Scaled  TKE dissipation rates are reduced from what is predicted by MOST during events with large  wave-coherent surface fluxes, resulting in a dissipation deficit in the energy budget (roughly 30%).  However we find that shear is much less impacted by these wave events showing much smaller  deviations from baselines (less than 10%).",High,,Gilbert Hall UGA
